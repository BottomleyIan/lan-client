You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write functional, maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.

## Repository Conventions

- Track all work with Beads: create, plan, and update tasks via `bd` (no markdown checklists); keep issue status current.
- Use the repo's pinned package manager (`npm@11.7.0`) to avoid lockfile churn; prefer `npm ci` for reproducible installs.
- Default to Angular v21 standalone patterns; do not add the `standalone` flag in decorators because it's implicit.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain

## Angular Best Practices

- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It's the default in Angular v20+.
- Use signals for state management; prefer Observables for data/loading flows (as currently used) and convert to signals only when needed for the view
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
  - `NgOptimizedImage` does not work for inline base64 images.

## Accessibility Requirements

- It MUST pass all AXE checks.
- It MUST follow all WCAG AA minimums, including focus management, color contrast, and ARIA attributes.

### Components

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- Do NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead
- When using external templates/styles, use paths relative to the component TS file.

## State Management

- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead

## Templates

- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables
- Do not assume globals like (`new Date()`) are available.
- Do not write arrow functions in templates (they are not supported).

## Services

- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection

## Icons

- Add or edit icons in `src/app/ui/icon/icons.ts` (define `viewBox` and `paths` arrays); the `IconName` union derives from this file.
- Use `<app-icon>` for inline icons and `<app-icon-button>` for icon-only actions; always pass a descriptive `label` to `app-icon-button` for screen readers.
  Use 'bd' for task tracking

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Git Workflow Exception

- Do not create commits or push changes. Leave git operations to the user.
